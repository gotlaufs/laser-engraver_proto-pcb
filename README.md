# Test your PCB production capabilities!

Work-in-progress.

Test PCB for calibrating laser engraver PCB production process.
This of course could be used to test any home-etched PCB processes capabilities.

The PCB has various common package footprints and some lines with different thicknesses.

### Component footprints on board 

    | Package | Pin pitch (mm) |
    |---------|----------------|
    | SOIC    |           1.27 |
    | DFN     |           0.95 |
    | TQFP    |            0.8 |
    | QFN     |           0.65 |
    | TSSOP   |           0.65 |
    | QSOP    |          0.635 |
    | TQFP    |            0.5 |
    | TQFP    |            0.4 |
    |         |                |
